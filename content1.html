        <h1>What do you need?</h1>

        <p>You might answer that you need the latest smart phone, good exam results, or a pay rise. Or you might think that you need a new relationship. But can you say that any of these will satisfy your inner need? What is our need and how can it be met? </p>

        <p>Deep within our being, we sense a need for something, and yet we may not know what we need. We struggle to satisfy the inward hunger with many different things, such as physical food and material possessions, yet our human life is full of shortage and vanity and is insufficient to meet our real need. The satisfaction we find is always temporary and before long we have a need for something else. The Lord knows our real need, and He is also the One who is able to meet our need. He knows exactly what we need, and more than that, He is able to fully supply our need.</p>

        <p>So what do we really need?</p>

        <p>To satisfy our inner hunger, what we need is the real, spiritual food. This food is the life of the Lord Jesus. His life is abundant, eternal, and fulfilling, able to meet our innermost need. Nothing else can satisfy us, and nothing else can supply and sustain us. The Lord Jesus does not demand that we struggle to find satisfaction for ourselves; instead, He supplies us by feeding us with Himself.</p>

        <p>John 6:35, "Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst."</p>

        <p>The way to receive the life of the Lord Jesus is to come to Him with an open heart and say: "Lord Jesus, I need You. I have tried many things, but nothing has satisfied me. You are the bread of life. I receive You right now as my life and life supply. Just as daily we must eat physical food to supply and strengthen our body, so daily we must also eat Jesus as the spiritual food to meet our every need. One of the best ways to do this is to read the Bible, the Word of God.</p>

        <p>Read the Bible today and call on the name of the Lord Jesus!</p>
