        <h1>Three Laws</h1>

        <p>I have a few questions for you:</p>
        <div class="unordered-list">
            <ul>
            <li>Have you ever experienced depression?</li>
            <li>Have you ever felt angry?</li>
            <li>Have you ever been worried about something?</li>
            <li>Have you ever been dishonest?</li>
            <li>Have you ever felt like a failure?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>If you answered "yes" to all of these questions, please know that you are not alone.</p>
        <p>No matter how hard we try not to sin, why is that we still fail over and over again?</p>
        <div class="ordered-list">
            <ol>
            <li>The law of God, outside of man</li>
            <li>The law of good in the mind</li>
            <li>The law of sin in man's flesh</li>
            </ol>

        <p>The law of God is just, good, holy, and spiritual. This law is outside of us or we may say that it is above us. This law of God makes many demands and requirements of the fallen man that he might be exposed. The law of good is in the mind of man's soul. We may say that the law of good in our mind corresponds to the law of God and responds to its demands, trying to keep it. Whenever the law of God places a demand upon us, the good law in our soul responds to it. The law of sin, which wars against the law of good. It constantly wars against the law of good and makes man a captive. Whenever the law of good responds to the law of God and attempts to fulfill the requirements of the law of God, the evil law in our flesh is aroused.</p>

        <p>Man is helpless, even though within man there is a good intention, but the problem is there is a law of sin and death and this always overcome in us because the stronger law overcomes the weaker law. The law of good is from human life so it is always defeated by the law of sin and death which is from Satan. Thus, we are always defeated and unable to fulfill the demand of God.</p>

        <p>However there is a fourth law which is only found in those who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE!</p>

        <p>The Lord made a way for us to overcome all the negative things. Romans 8:2 says,"For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." God passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, death and resurrection. In His resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit which is the fourth law, the law of the Spirit of life in us today. Now that the Lord Jesus has been processed to be the law of the Spirit of life, we can now overcome through Him. Whenever and wherever we may be just call on the name of the Lord with a believing heart, "Oh, Lord Jesus!" Now the law of the Spirit of life has been installed in our spirit which is the highest and strongest law, which liberates us from the second law and fulfills all the requirements of the first law. Hallelujah!</p>
